# FurniARt - Augmented Reality-Based Online Furniture Store

This repository contains all the documents and materials related to my Final Year Project (FYP) on developing an Augmented Reality (AR)-based Online Furniture Store. This project aims to revolutionize the online shopping experience by allowing customers to visualize and interact with 3D furniture models in their physical environment.

## Project Overview

### Abstract
The goal of this project is to create an AR-based online furniture store that enhances customer experience by providing an immersive way to view and interact with virtual 3D furniture models in their own space. This platform bridges the gap between online and offline shopping, helping customers make well-informed purchasing decisions.

### Introduction
